# Echoes Web — Live Progress Log

Goal: fully playable, responsive top-down party roguelike ("Echoes" design from
GameStudio) in Three.js, judged against commercial reference screenshots
(docs/REFERENCE_BAR.md). Builder/critic loops per block; critics review rendered
pixels and running gameplay only.

## Status: PHASE 1 — Design exploration

| # | Time (session) | Event |
|---|----------------|-------|
| 1 | T0 | Recon: found GameStudio "Echoes" concept + art bible (approved). Node v24, npm 11 available. |
| 2 | T0 | Wrote docs/REFERENCE_BAR.md — 10-point pixel rubric + responsiveness bar distilled from the 4 reference screenshots. |
| 3 | T0 | Launching design-digest workflow over GameStudio GDDs → BUILD_BRIEF.md. |
| 4 | T1 | 4/4 digest agents done (488k tokens); synthesis hit session limit once, resumed from cache. |
| 5 | T1 | Converted Pass the Fear AVIF → docs/reference/pass-the-fear.png (1920x1080); added as Reference D to rubric. |
| 6 | T1 | Scaffold live: Vite+three on port 5199, launch.json wired, WebGL frame captured in Browser pane — critic pixel-pipeline proven. |
