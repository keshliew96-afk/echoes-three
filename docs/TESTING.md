# Testing & Verification Contract

Binding for every builder and critic agent on this project.

## The one rule

**Nobody judges code by reading it.** Visual and gameplay claims are verified
against real rendered pixels and real console output, captured with the harness:

```bash
node tools/capture.mjs shot my-check --settle 3000
node tools/capture.mjs seq combat 8 250 --actions tools/actions/fight.json
```

- Output lands in `captures/` (gitignored): PNG frames + `<name>.console.txt`.
- Exit code 1 = an uncaught page error occurred. A builder may NOT return while
  the smoke capture exits 1.
- The dev server must be running on 127.0.0.1:5199 (`npm run dev`); do not spawn
  extra vite instances — reuse the port and leave the server up for others.
- Read the PNGs with the Read tool to actually look at them.

## Builder exit criteria (every block, every fix round)

1. `node tools/capture.mjs shot smoke` exits 0 (zero console/page errors).
2. The block's own acceptance criteria are self-checked against captured frames
   (or debug-API output) — not assumed from code.
3. `git add -A && git commit` with a conventional message; bump the version
   string in `src/version.js` (patch per block, displayed in the bottom-left
   corner of the screen like the Magicraft reference).

## Debug API (window.__echoes)

Implemented in the sim core block and extended as systems land. Minimum surface:

| Member | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `version` | current version string (same as bottom-left label) |
| `tick` | current sim tick (advances at 60 Hz) |
| `fps` | smoothed render fps |
| `entityCount` | live sim entities |
| `seed` | active run seed (`?seed=123` URL param forces it) |
| `events` | ring buffer (last 200) of sim events `{tick, type, ...}` — spawns, hits, deaths, drafts, denials |
| `state()` | JSON snapshot: room index, party HP/positions, enemies, wallet |
| `cmd(name, ...args)` | test commands: `spawn(type,x,z)`, `teleport(x,z)`, `setHp(id,pct)`, `giveSkill(id)`, `grantNode(id)`, `socket(skillId,nodeId)`, `skipToRoom(n)`, `killAllEnemies()`, `win()`, `lose()` |

Critics drive scenarios through `cmd` + real synthetic input (capture actions),
then judge frames. Determinism checks: load twice with the same `?seed=`, diff
`events`.
