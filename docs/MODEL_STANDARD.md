# Model standard (pilot, v0.5.332)

Kesh's sample video (a Claude Design "Leviathan" page, studied in
`/mnt/project-files/plan/MODEL_STANDARD.md`) builds its creature in code: faceted low-poly
planes, detail by repeating small parts, and abilities as named, rewindable timelines. He
picked option (d): build that technique into the game's own renderer. This pilot does it for
two models, the **Barrow Wyrm** and the **Tank**, so he can judge the look before any
roster slice. Visual only: no sim, timing, damage or golden changes.

His ruling for the pilot: the detail goes **on top of** the chibi ink-outline style
(BUILD_BRIEF §19.2), it does not replace it, and the facets must read clearly.

## The kit (`src/render/facet/`)

| File | What it gives |
|---|---|
| `material.js` | `facetize(geo, {jitter, seed})`: non-indexed geometry with flat normals and a per-plane value step in a `color` attribute (hashed from the face normal, so a plane keeps its tone as the model moves). `facetMaterial(color)`: the house toon material with vertex colours. Every faceted part keeps the 3-step toon ramp, so the light still bands like the rest of the game, and the facet step rides on top. |
| `kit.js` | The parts kit on `InstancedMesh`, so hundreds of plates cost two draw calls (the part and its ink hull): `createSpine(n)` (a Catmull-Rom spine with a stable frame), `createPlateTube` (ridged scales laid in a brick pattern round a moving spine, sized by the local arc length so a bend never opens a gap, with metal bands every few rings), `createSpineRow` (wedge spikes along the spine, with tinted tips), `placeRow` (any fixed row: teeth, rivets, crest fans, mail), `mottle` (per-instance tone), `wedgeGeometry`, `plateGeometry`. Part ink is `PART_INK_PX` (1.35 px), thinner than the silhouette's `INK_PX`. |
| `timeline.js` | `createTimeline(id, label, phases, {cues})`: pure in t (`sample(t)`, `startOf(phase)`, `readout(t)` for "1.2s · Ash Breath: strike"). `createPlayhead`: rate 1 plays, 0 holds, -1 rewinds; cues fire only on a forward crossing, so a rewind and replay re-fires each once. `ease`. |
| `flags.js` | `MODEL_STANDARD = {wyrm: true, tank: true}` and `facetOn(kind)`. A harness build reads `?facet=0` (every model classic) or `?facet=wyrm,tank` (only those); a player build never sees the param. |

`critters/common.js` gained `addInstancedInk(mesh, px)`: the same constant-pixel inverted
hull, drawn per instance from the part's own `instanceMatrix` buffer.

## The Barrow Wyrm (`src/render/boss/wyrmfacet.js`)

- **Body.** A 10-point spine through the head, the neck root and the coil. 34 rings of
  ridged slate scales (8 round the back, brick-laid) over a faceted core, a pewter band every
  7th ring, 15 dorsal spikes with pewter tips, 14 violet crack shards along the back. 388
  instances in all; 39 draw calls against the classic rig's 45.
- **Head.** A faceted skull and pale snout, horns and brow ridges, a 9-wedge crest fan,
  12 upper and 10 lower teeth on a hinged jaw, violet eyes and throat glow.
- **The coil follows its own path.** The neck root leaves a trail on the floor; every body
  point sits on that trail, so a turning Wyrm bends through its turn. The serpentine wave
  is fixed to the trail's arc length (a no-slip wave): a moving Wyrm slides through its
  curves instead of sliding over the ground. At rest the coil breathes a small sway.
  A turntable (the Journal viewer passes `turntable: true`) turns the coil rigidly with
  the head; the death collapse freezes the coil where it lay.
- **Abilities** (`WYRM_ABILITIES`), driven by the sim in game:
  - *Ash Breath*: draw back 0.9 s, strike 0.18 s, pour 0.5 s, settle 0.6 s. The draw is
    stretched to the sim's telegraph span; the strike lands when the telegraph resolves.
  - *Burrow Strike*: dive 0.5 s, tunnel 1.2 s, rise 0.9 s, burst 0.25 s, exposed 1.5 s,
    settle 0.6 s. Tunnel, rise and exposed hold for as long as the sim's mode does.
  The legless rule: the coil's base stays planted while the head and neck drive (only the
  first points lift; the probe checks the base moves no more than its rest sway).
- **Colour.** Slate scales from the enemy hide family (cool, as foes read), a low-saturation
  pewter for the bands and tips (the video's gold would sit in the reserved amber family),
  God-stuff Violet glow as the classic rig. No Ember, no Bright Heal.

## The Tank (`src/render/critters/tankfacet.js`)

- **Body.** The classic Tank's chibi masses, faceted: a 10-sided coat bell, a tabard with
  4 rows of scale mail, a plated belt with brass rivets, the collar, a faceted head with the
  unchanged painted face, faceted ears, snout and arms. The shield is a shoulder block with
  three ridged lames, a crest of three steel spikes and a slab with a boss and six studs.
  Brass is the classic buckle tongue's dull Bone-into-Umber (no Earth Ochre or gold on the
  body; Bone stays the brightest value, round-3 F9). 47 draw calls against 39.
- **3-hit combo** (Kesh's template), at the sim's real 0.65 s swing cadence:
  1. *Backhand bash*: horizontal, slab side across to the far side.
  2. *Rising bash*: low on the far side, up across to high on the slab side, clear of the face.
  3. *Crushing slam*: overhead on the toes, both paws on the slab, down into the ground
     ahead with a lunge step.

  Each hit has key poses (wind-up, strike, overshoot) and frame timing: 1.5 frames of
  wind-up (only from rest), 2.5 strike, 2 overshoot, 5 to settle **into the next hit's
  wind-up**, held for the combo window (1.0 s), then a recover. A chained hit starts from
  wherever the last one is, so the chain never pops. The rig counts its own swings from the
  `ally_basic` cue; a skill or a hit taken starts the chain over.
- **Weight.** The hips lead the swing by 1 frame and the slab trails by 2, so the body
  throws the slab; the off paw joins it for the heavy blows; the root shifts its weight over
  the planted feet, crouches into each wind-up and drives up or down through the strike.
- **Abilities.** *Heavy Slam* (every melee arc and ground skill: Heavy Slam, Brutal Cleave,
  Ground Crack, Shoulder Charge, Earthshatter) and *Brace* (every nova, direct and aura
  skill: Whirling Guard, Taunting Roar, Shield Wall, Iron Stance, Rallying Cry, Earthen
  Grasp). In game a skill enters its timeline 0.08 s before the strike, so the blow lands
  with the sim's hit.
- **Locked feet.** Each foot is pinned to the floor in world space while it carries
  weight and steps on its own when the stance's home drifts 0.085 u away, one foot at a
  time, landing ahead along the travel at the home it lifted off for (so the slam's lunge
  lands). The walk's bob, roll and hip twist come from the steps, and the lean follows the
  travel in the Tank's own frame: a backpedal leans back, a sidestep leans aside, whatever
  the aim. A collapse unlocks the feet.

## Integration

- `render/boss/index.js` and `ui/story/viewerrigs.js` build `buildWyrmFacet` when
  `facetOn('wyrm')`; it keeps the classic rig's interface (`group`, `mats`, `setYaw`,
  `setFlash`, `pose`).
- `critters/index.js` builds `buildTankFacet` when `facetOn('tank')`. The rig's `apply`
  receives the driver's clip name; the critter API gains `cue(kind, ev)` (forwarded from
  `render/allies/index.js` on `ally_basic` / `ally_cast`, and from the camp's seat casts),
  `lab` and `modelStandard`. The classic rigs ignore all three.
- The classic rigs (`boss/wyrm.js`, `critters/tank.js`) are untouched and stay beside them.

## The model lab (`?modellab=1`, harness only)

`scenes/modellab.js` and `ui/modellab.js`: the video's toolbar. Model tabs (Barrow Wyrm,
Tank, Effect kit), Idle / Move / Ability / Still, the ability buttons (the Tank's basic
combo, Heavy Slam, Brace; the Wyrm's Ash Breath, Burrow Strike), Rewind, Showcase or Play
zoom (the game camera's 45° field at 12 u and 52°), Turntable, Classic beside, a scrub bar
that holds Still, and the live readout. Each cue beat plays its game sound and a VFX burst.
URL: `?modellab=1&model=tank&mode=ability&ability=combo&view=play&classic=1`. Probes drive
it with `__echoes.cmd('lab', {model, mode, ability, t, rate, view, turntable, classic})`.

## Adding a model to the standard

1. Build it with the kit: faceted parts (`facetize` + `facetMaterial`), repeated detail on
   `InstancedMesh` with `addInstancedInk`, the same rig interface as its classic twin.
2. Give each ability a timeline with named phases; drive it from the sim's telegraphs and
   modes in game, from the playhead in the lab.
3. Heroes and biped foes get the 3-hit combo template; run the self-check (root motion
   matches the legs, planted feet locked until the weight shifts, hips and legs drive each
   swing; a legless body keeps its base planted).
4. Add it to `MODEL_STANDARD`, a lab tab, and a check in `tools/model-standard-probe.mjs`.
5. Shoot it in the lab and at play zoom in a busy fight beside its classic twin.

## Probe

`node tools/model-standard-probe.mjs` (in `npm test`): timelines pure and rewindable;
flat facets; every instanced part inked; the Wyrm's no-slip coil, planted base, breath and
burrow driving, turntable and death freeze; the Tank's chain continuity, cadence, skill
coverage, hips before slab, locked feet in eight directions, steps along the travel, the
lean, the lunge; the flag; no reserved or amber colours; Bone brightest on the Tank.
